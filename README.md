#Agree

## Make group decisions. Faster. Easier. Better. Agree is a web application where you can invite participants, take equal turns making suggestions via RTC, and vote on your favorites. A timer makes sure that the decision is being made and everybody has an equal opportunity to share their idea.

### TalkTech

Let's say you want to go out with your friends for dinner, to karaoke, or to the movies. But the decision on where to go, what to do or buy, is taking forever (right?). Valueable time is being lost and the moods are sinking. Often one or two people are leading a discussion, and quiet group members may not get the chance to voice their opinion, or have it taken seriously. Sometimes it seems like there is only 1 person making a decision that should be up to everyone.

We have found a solution to these problems. Agree is our hack for this situation.

We use SkyWay WebRTC technology to connect with others. All of the members are invited and all have limited but equal amounts of time to present their ideas without being interrupted. This can be anywhere from 20 seconds onward. While they would make suggestions, the other members would have an option to vote anonymously or non-anonymously on someones proposal.

The web app could be also used for other purposes, like for example when brainstorming with a study group, as it is in our intention to extend the app for more varied purposes.

In cases where the app is used for voting, when all members have proposed and voted, AGREE will turn out the result. This allows people to honestly voice their option and opinion without being afraid of judgement from the others, and acknowledges all opinions equally. It takes the responsibility for the decision from a single person, and at the same time makes sure that a decision is made.
